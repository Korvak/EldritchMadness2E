/**
 *  a lootbag allows trading items with a character. It can also have locking features such as
 *  requiring a key or certain item to access the lootbag's inventory and could have a lockpick system
 *  if it gets implemented.
 * 
 *  all lotbags, chests and other containers that may contain objects, apart from traders, are lootbag actors.
 * 
 *  The lootbag actor is one of the few actor that can be a token.
