 * 
 *  A character should be an actor capable of movement, interaction, combat , dialogue and more complex type of actions.
 *  It should be the type of actor with the most agency possible and the players should use characters instead of pawns
 *  or actors.

 *  A pawn should be an actor capable of movement and combat. It should not be able to do more complex actions such as forging,
 *  investigating or dialogue. Pawns are rarely under the control of players but it can happen such owning a vehicle.
 *  Since a pawn is capable of combat, it should have an anatomy.
 * 
 *      * Examples of pawns : 
 *              - turrets / siege weapons
 *              - traps
 *              - vehicles

 * Actors are the most unique since they are 
 * tailored to their functions and each perform their unique task.

 *              - chests / loot bags
